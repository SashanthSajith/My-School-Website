            <h2>Vikas-The Concept School came into existence with a vision for holistic education in 1999 under Samaikya Educations Pvt. Ltd led by Late.Sri Koteswara Rao, whose idea was to produce the most exceptional intellectuals in the country and took a full form in 2003. Following its huge success, Ameya World School was established in 2009 with a mission to empower learners to explore, experiment, and experience. With continued support and demand from the parents to be a part of this esteemed institution, we went ahead with establishing Epistemo Vikas Leadership School in 2012, with the primary objective of nurturing young minds by imparting training, dissemination of knowledge with the most innovative and proven methodologies of teaching.</h2>
